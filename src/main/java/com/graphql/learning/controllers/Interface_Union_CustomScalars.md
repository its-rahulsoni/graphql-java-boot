Great question, Rahul! 👏

You’re asking:

> *“What is the Postman query for the GraphQL interface example where we return a list of `User` types (`Admin`, `Customer`), and they implement a common `User` interface?”*

Let’s walk through it ✅

---

## ✅ GraphQL Schema Recap (Interface Example)

```graphql
interface User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Admin implements User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  accessLevel: String!
}

type Customer implements User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  purchaseHistory: [String!]!
}

type Query {
  allUsers: [User!]!
}
```

## ✅ Postman Request: GraphQL Query with Inline Fragments

In GraphQL, when the return type is an **interface** or **union**,
you use **`... on TypeName`** to specify which fields to fetch depending on the actual object type.

### 🔹 Query Body for Postman

```json
{
  "query": "query { allUsers { id name ... on Admin { accessLevel } ... on Customer { purchaseHistory } } }"
}
```

---

## ✅ How It Works:

* `id`, `name` come from the **interface** `User` (common to all)
* `... on Admin { accessLevel }` fetches Admin-specific field
* `... on Customer { purchaseHistory }` fetches Customer-specific field

---

## ✅ Sample Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allUsers": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Rahul",
        "accessLevel": "SUPER_ADMIN"
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "Amit",
        "purchaseHistory": ["Item1", "Item2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

Excellent follow-up, Rahul 👏
Let’s **fully clarify** that confusing part of the query:

---

## 🤔 Why do we write this?

```graphql
id
name
... on Admin {
  accessLevel
}
... on Customer {
  purchaseHistory
}
```

The short answer is:

> Because `allUsers` returns a **list of `User` interface objects**, and each actual item might be of a different **concrete type** like `Admin` or `Customer`.

So you must **tell GraphQL which fields to pick from each concrete type.**
This is done using **inline fragments**: `... on <TypeName> { fields }`

---

## ✅ Let’s break it down line by line:

```graphql
allUsers {
  id
  name
```

🔹 These fields (`id`, `name`) come from the `User` **interface**,
so they are **available on all subtypes** (Admin, Customer, etc.)

---

```graphql
  ... on Admin {
    accessLevel
  }
```

🔹 This means:

> “If this user is of type `Admin`, also fetch `accessLevel` field.”

---

```graphql
  ... on Customer {
    purchaseHistory
  }
```

🔹 This means:

> “If this user is of type `Customer`, also fetch `purchaseHistory` field.”

---

## 🧠 Why we **need `on` keyword** here?

Because the server doesn't know **what actual type** each object in the list is (until runtime).
So you are saying:

> “Only try to fetch `accessLevel` if the object is of type `Admin`.”

---

## 📌 Without `... on`, your query will fail

If you just write:

```graphql
allUsers {
  id
  name
  accessLevel
}
```

It will throw an error ❌ because `accessLevel` doesn’t exist on the `User` interface.

---

## ✅ Analogy: Think of Java

```java
interface User {
  String getId();
  String getName();
}

class Admin implements User {
  String getAccessLevel();
}

class Customer implements User {
  List<String> getPurchaseHistory();
}
```

Now if you have:

```java
List<User> users = fetchUsers();
```

You’d do:

```java
for (User u : users) {
   if (u instanceof Admin admin) {
      admin.getAccessLevel();
   } else if (u instanceof Customer cust) {
      cust.getPurchaseHistory();
   }
}
```

GraphQL `... on Type` is **exactly this same pattern**!

---

## ✅ Final Summary

* `... on TypeName { fields }` is an **inline fragment**
* It tells GraphQL:

  > “If the actual type is `X`, fetch these specific fields.”
* Necessary when you're querying interfaces or unions with **polymorphic return types**
* Prevents runtime errors & keeps the query strongly typed

Let me know if you'd like to visualize this using a Postman demo or React component!
